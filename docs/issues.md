# Issues

1. Use a style template

    ```md
    - [ ] Choose a front-end template to use
      * Try searching for “Free React Templates” or use one of these [35 Free React Templates](https://dev.to/davidepacilio/35-free-react-templates-and-themes-32ci)
    ```

2. Build a home page

    ```md
    - [ ] Create a header with navigation
    - [ ] Include the UC logo in the header with the site title
    - [ ] Create a footer with the message "Developed by students, faculty, and alumni at the Information Technology Solutions Center"
    - [ ] Create a section with an embedded live stream from YouTube
    - [ ] Create a section with a mock schedule for the event
    ```

3. Build a project list page

    ```md
    - [ ] Create a page for each project type to list the projects (This can be one template page that receives JSON data to populate the title and projects, but doesn’t have to be)
      - [ ] DevOps
      - [ ] OCAT
      - [ ] VEaaS
      - [ ] CECH Web
    - [ ] For each project type, display each project by the name of the person working on it. Find a way to make this look better than just a list of links.
    ```

4. Create a template page to showcase each project

    ```md
    - [ ] Create a page that receives JSON data and then populates the template page with the required information. There might be a different template page for each project type, but there doesn't have to be
      - [ ] DevOps
      - [ ] OCAT
      - [ ] VEaaS
      - [ ] CECH Web
    - [ ] Create a section to describe the project
    - [ ] Create a section that includes the name of the person working on the project
    - [ ] Create a section for a YouTube video embed of the person working on the project explaining the project (use any placeholder video for now)
    ```

5. Publish the site to Netlify

    ```md
    - [ ] Create a netlify account
    - [ ] Login to netlify on your command line
    - [ ] Deploy your site to netlify
    - [ ] Comment the link to the netlify site on this issue
    ```

6. Prepare presentation

    ```md
    - [ ] Prepare your presentation
    ```

7. Integrate live chat

    ```md
    * Recommend using [Disqus](https://disqus.com/)
    * There is a React wrapper for Disqus that makes it very easy to implement called [Disqus-React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/disqus-react)
    - [ ] Add a live discussion to each project page that is separate from the other project pages (i.e. commenting on one project only shows on the one project)
    - [ ] Ensure that new comments show up without refreshing the page
    ```

8. Implement an event countdown

    ```md
    - [ ] Create a countdown timer on the home page that counts down to the start of the event
    - [ ] Use that timer to prevent users from accessing the project pages until the countdown is complete
    ```

9. Add a pre-event video

    ```md
    - [ ] Use the countdown timer to change the live stream to a static video until the the event starts
    ```
